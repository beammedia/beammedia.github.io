								<p>Even with Internet access rate rising every year and mobile Internet rate reaching new heights, according to this year’s survey, 10.8 percent of the public still don’t use the Internet. Majority of the people not connected to the Internet are over the age of 60, with those that “don’t need it” (29.9%), “due to fear or unfamiliarity with computers” (27.0%) and “no interest” (26.6%). While the infrastructure, hardware and software environment are mature and developed, a variety of products and services are developed through the Internet. The government and industry should think more about the reasons and solutions for the digital gap. The reason for why there isn’t any demand is that they are not familiar with the Internet, cannot use it, or they are not satisfied with their current service. They should learn from the thinking of differentiating the masses by Internet services, understand their needs, interests and pain points of senior citizens, and actively implement the vision of providing fair digital opportunities.</p>

								<p>The results show that in the situation of wireless Internet, mobile Internet and wireless area Internet access are all complementary to each other. Although the mobile Internet rate is as high as 84.6%, 40.3% of Internet users also use wireless Internet due to “poor reception in mobile Internet” (33.1%), “free of charge” (19.8%), “reduce mobile Internet traffic” (19.6%). It shows that mobile Internet and wireless Internet are not completely in competition with each other, but that Internet users use them alternately according to their current network speed or situation.</p>
								<p>With regards to the strategy of building a large number of public WIFI hotspots, we could consider re-shaping the positioning of wireless area’ network. It isn’t necessary to add more public WiFi hotspots to improve the access rate or quality of Internet. Collaborating with mobile Internet to improve the mobile Internet rate with higher utilization is also a way to meet network demand.</p>

								<p>As seen from the survey, of the nearly 10 percent increase in mobile payments usage this year, even though brand usage has not changed much, it also found that PXPay, which official has entered the market this year, is on the rise. Further analysis shows that among netizens using mobile payment, 55% use one payment tool brand, 28.5% use two, and 10.2% use three. It is obvious that most users use three or less payment brands. Meanwhile, it also indicates that the ratio of single payment to multiple payments is 55% and 43.3%, with a difference of approximately 10%. Upon analysis of the users of the new brand PXPay, more than 60% of them use other payment brands at the same time. Therefore, for the mobile payment market, although the majority of netizens use a single brand, there are opportunities to increase and use other brands.</p>
								<p>For Internet service providers or the industry itself, it also shows that mobile payment in addition to the utilization rate of ascension space, also has the potentially increasing each brand tool users. Therefore, differentiating masses to understand the needs of each group is very important. The rise of PXPay explains the rise in usage rates that combine online services with offline purchases.</p>

								<p>Netizens are 98% aware of threats to network information security and nearly 90% or more are aware of various frauds, malicious file programs and methods of defrauding personal information. Even so, from the network crime number statistics released by the DGBAS of the Executive Yuan, there still were 13,714 pieces of crime over the past year, including high awareness crimes such as fraud, obstructing computer use and so on. It shows that netizens can only be regarded as the level of knowledge on the mastery ability of information security incidents, while it is necessary to increase knowledge to understand the risks and prevention methods.</p>
								<p>Government and industry can play an important role in education, ranging from infrastructure, hardware and software, applications, to human operations and control, and there is room for re-implementation. As business opportunities mature, information security is the field of developing innovation business models.</p>

								<p>While the Internet service industry in foreign countries is actively using personal information to provide more diversified services and create a new Blue Ocean market, the application of personal information in Taiwan’s Internet industry tends to be conservative. And the public’s understanding of personal information law and the future use of personal information is only 30%. Most people’s perception of personal information rights is limited to passive querying/browsing/updating/deleting. Taiwan, with such high Internet access rate, should first ensure that in a safe environment, they should more actively explore the positive use of personal information, so that each and every consumer can truly control their personal information and enjoy the value of it.</p>
